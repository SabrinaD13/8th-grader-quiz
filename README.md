# Are you smarter than an 8th grader quiz

User wants:
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

Description:
I have added a lot of features and functions I created in Javascript, my original project got deleted so I started this one from scratch and finished it in a day. Not my best work but it will do! I decided to create a score instead of a timer.
